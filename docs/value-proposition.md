## The problem

In traditional learning, we encounter several problems. Many learning methods are monotonous and lack interactivity, which negatively impacts learners' motivation. Additionally, there are often no flexible options to integrate learning into daily life, especially in short time slots. Another issue is the lack of control over learning progress, leading to an unclear assessment of one's own abilities. Finally, feedback is often delayed or entirely absent, which negatively affects the learning process. Our app addresses these challenges by making learning interactive, flexible, and data-driven, allowing users to accurately track their progress and target their weaknesses effectively.

## Our solution

Quiz Learning offers an interactive, motivating, and data-driven quiz system. It combines modern learning methods with gamified elements and flexible usage options to provide an effective and engaging learning experience.

1. **Dynamic Quiz Experience and Gamification to Boost Motivation**  
Traditional learning methods are often monotonous and fail to sufficiently challenge learners. Our app incorporates gamification elements to maintain motivation:  
- **Random Quiz & Category Selection**: Users can either play a mixed quiz or focus on a specific topic of their choice.  
- **Point System**: Users earn points for each correct answer, which are reflected in their personal progress system.

2. **Flexible Learning in Short, Efficient Sessions**  
Many learners have limited time for studying. Our app enables:  
- **Quizzes with Only 5 Questions**: A compact format that can be completed in just a few minutes—ideal for short breaks or learning on the go.  
- **Multiple-Choice Format**: Questions are structured simply, allowing users to answer them without extensive preparation.  

3. **Detailed Progress Tracking with Visualizations**  
Users gain access to comprehensive analytics to improve their knowledge effectively:  
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Displays the number of quizzes played, success rate, and the user’s strongest and weakest categories.  
- **Personalized Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis**: The app identifies recurring mistakes and provides targeted recommendations for areas that need improvement.  

4. **Immediate & Intelligent Feedback for More Effective Learning**  
- **Instant Answer Evaluation**: Users receive immediate feedback after each question, allowing them to learn from their mistakes.  
- **Learning History & Long-Term Analysis**: Users can track their progress over weeks or months to see which topics they have improved in.
